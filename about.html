    <h1 class="H1_Text2">(Why the buisness was made)</h1> 
    <h2 class="H2_Text">Addiction Eviction was created because the C.E.O Bryson Johnson Mosby knew from a young age how bad drugs, alcohol, and smoking could be. Bryson was constantly reminded about the effects of drugs, alcohol, and smoking. Every time he heard that someone was using drugs, alcohol, or smoking they had either died or their lives were ruined. Not only do drugs, alcohol, and smoke effect your mind, but they can also effect other parts of your body like your skin, hair, chest, nose, kidneys, lungs, mouth, and heart. Even some of his own family had used some harmful substances. Some people had snuck them into their food or drinks without them knowing. some people even drink or smoke in their car which makes the risk of getting into a car accident even higher! Worst of all some people are sneaking drugs into Africa! Bryson was fed up with people speeding up their one way trip to their graves. So he decided to make his own buisness that would help people get off of their addiction, and doing so make the world a little bit better. Who knows maybe in a few years people will stop making things like crack, beer, and sigars, because there will no requests for them. </h2>
